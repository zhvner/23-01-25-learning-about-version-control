# Learning about Version Control
Author: Zhanerke Zhumash (25401332)
Solving merge conflicts takes conscious effort, but I can do it!

- what I like the most about version control is that it is possible to track every change made to code and easily revert to previous versions if errors occur.
- I feel like it could be challenging to use version control with multiple users when encountering merge conflicts or having inconsistent documentation of things.
